## Casting Registers

The second register set to be treated by the **CFRP**, the casting registers span from 1765 to 1793. The *feux* (fire) registers in French, named for the firewood or candles given to actors performing each evening to heat and light their dressing rooms (*loges*), these records detail, for each performance, which actors played which roles. Though much of the data around the plays performed was already available via the receipts database, the casting records additionally include performances which took place outside of the regular CF venues.

There are two possible access points to the casting data. The API is the preferred method, as it is always pulling from the most up to date copy of the data, but for increased flexibility, it is also possible to download a copy of the full database in the form of a PostgreSQL dump file.
