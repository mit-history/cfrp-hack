# Overview

The purpose of the **Comédie Française Registers Project** is to capture data from the registers of the Comédie Française Theater in Paris:

- [Receipt Registers](https://www.cfregisters.org/fr/registres/registres-des-recettes)
- [Casting Registers](https://www.cfregisters.org/fr/registres/registres-des-feux) and
- [Expense Registers](https://www.cfregisters.org/fr/registres/registres-des-dépenses).

The project is also working on recipes from the 19th century, as well as those from the 17th and 18th centuries. The registers themselves are kept in volumes linked to the archives of the theater of the Comédie Française (CF) in Paris. This data was entered "by hand", using an online data entry application.

This website provides documentation for the use of the data so entered from each of these sets of records.

- [Receipt Registers](/receipts/)
- [Casting Registers](/feux/)

### Publications

These data have been used in an article published by the MIT Press: [*"Databases, Revenues, & Repertory
The French Stage Online, 1680-1793"*](https://cfrp.mitpress.mit.edu/).
